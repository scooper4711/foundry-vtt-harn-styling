# Hârn Foundry VTT Journals

![Example Image of this CSS](images/screenshot.png)

## Usage
1. After you install this module, you will have a "Hârnic" inspired formatting to your
   journal entries. This is mostly based on [D&D 5th Edition PHB Journal Styling for Foundry VTT](https://github.com/Daxiongmao87/foundry-vtt-5e-phb-journal-styling), but with some minor tweaks.
2. Additionally, when editing, there are several changes to the editor.
3. There is now a font selector drop-down as well as a font size selector. The default
   fonts remain, but the styled fonts are listed at the bottom. This includes a font
   for Lankorian Blackhand (the script for Hârnic) provided by Mitch Gore on [Lythia.com](https://www.lythia.com/discussion/game-elements/lankorian-blackhand-font/).

4. Font and Background color selection tools are now available
5. If you are editing a table, you can get a fancy border around the table under the
   style selector.
